# sovereign_cloud
This is for all data related to sovereignty cloud models, that use QAI technologies and can interface with various computing models like supercomputing, quantum computing, DNA computing to name a few models.

Few key points are listed below: 

1)	QAI Sovereign cloud models for public, private, hybrid, industrial control systems, and domain specific models.
2)	Multi sovereign cloud models personalized to country, province, and county governance policies.
3)	Cross Sovereignty cloud integrated model that can cross geo borders and can still follow local rules 
4)	Sovereignty hub model to interface, Interact using intelligent automation based on all the cloud rules, policies and legalities.
5)	This reduces lots of manual efforts, overheads to the cross border teams, security, government affairs, commerce etc.
6)	It can be used for economic well being and also counter any attacks in the cyber physical realms.
7)	This can help improve integrity of the nation, business affairs, and realize true visions of owners that allow full transparency in hiring, misuse of authority, power, and money in any transaction that can affect productivity. This also in quickly capturing of the wrong doings at all levels that will help in remediation with proof
8)	Allowing opportunities for the right and merit with zero bias of any sort allowing for rapid progress in technology, economy and wealth.
9)	These models will use QAI ASI, Solution Cafe, QAI intelligent hub and various emerging technologies that allow better communications, use proxies, international data exchange, common based, Sovereignty STDs etc, allowing for better control over inland data and internet websites.
10)	Many automated use case emerge and these can leverage automation to do lots of manual tasks with human in loop for approvals. In summary this is an Intelligence backed low power technology that can help boost economy making best of individual merit, right job for deserving people allowing max utilization of inland knowledge, merit and human skills.
11)	This qualifies for NIW projects.
12)	Develop sample models, templates and code that can be reused in other projects.
13)	Folders for, QAI Sovereignty cloud, QAI Sovereignty datacenter, subfolders for Public, private, hybrid, ICS-OT, Domain Sovereignty cloud, Cloud made of Sovereignty datacenters, combinations like public BFSI domain for B2C, Private BFSI domain for B2B, etc these cloud models are specialized zones needed for secrecy, privacy, autonomous control 
14)	For this structure these can be attached policies, rule of sovereignty etc data islands made out of the vast internet.
15)	These are linked to certain domains, Govt portfolios, governance models like Cloud security, etc
16)	Make a simple diagram for the hierarchy and how the industry zones, businesses, projects, jobs, etc all human productivity is tracked 
17)	This offers real time automated, governance and helps ease in nabbing any mischief, human biases etc in any activity, no need for victim to file case, these are alerted to authority and the thief get caught 
18)	COBIT, ministerial orders, bye laws, legalities, all ethics can be made effective without disputes and factors from human authorities. Lawyer agents are assigned to both parties to know in their language, faith allowing for easier defense.
